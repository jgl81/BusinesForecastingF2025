#This model has an ME of 101.80. Using the ME metric, this model is by far the lest accurate and seems to produce the most error. Given that this is my last forecast, the best model here is RWF. This model did under forecast overall, but given that the forecast is fore jobs added per month, there are not additional costs for under-forecasting like in demand planning.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
